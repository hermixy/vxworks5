DESCRIPTION
This library implements the MS-DOS compatible file system.
This is a multi-module library, which depends on sub-modules to
perform certain parts of the file system functionality.
A number of different file system format variations are supported.

USING THIS LIBRARY
The various routines provided by the VxWorks DOS file system (dosFs) may be
separated into three broad groups: general initialization, device
initialization, and file system operation.

The dosFsLibInit() routine is the principal initialization function; it should
be called once during system initialization, regardless of how many dosFs
devices are to be used.

Another dosFs routine is used for device initialization. 
For each dosFs device, dosFsDevCreate() must be called to install the
device in VxWorks device list.
In the case where partitioned disks are used, dosFsDevCreate() must be
called for each partition that is anticipated, thereby it is associated
with a logical device name, so it can be later accessed via the I/O
system.

In case of a removable disk, dosFsDevCreate() must be called during
system initialization time, even if a cartridge or diskette may be
absent from the drive at boot time. dosFsDevCreate() will only
associate the device with a logical device name. Device access will be
done only when the logical device is first accessed by the application.

More detailed information on all of these routines is provided below.

INITIALIZING DOSFSLIB
To enable this file system in a particular VxWorks configuration,
a library initialization routine must be called for each sub-module of
the file system, as well as for the underlying disk cache, partition
manager and drivers.
This is usually done at system initialization time, within the 
.I usrRoot
task context.

Following is the list of initialization routines that need to be
called:
.IP dosFsLibInit
(mandatory) initialize the principle dosFs module. Must be called first.
.IP dosFsFatInit
(mandatory) initialize the File Allocation Table handler, which supports
12-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit FATs.
.IP dosVDirLibInit
(choice) install the variable size directory handler
supporting Windows-compatible Long File Names (VFAT) Directory
Handler.
.IP dosDirOldLibInit
(choice) install the fixed size  directory handler
which supports old-fashioned 8.3
MS-DOS file names, and Wind River Systems proprietary long file names
(VXLONG).
.IP dosFsFmtLibInit
(optional) install the volume formatting module.
.IP dosChkLibInit
(optional) install the file system consistency checking module.
.LP
The two Directory handlers which are marked
.I choice
are installed in accordance with the system requirements, either one
of these modules could be installed or both, in which case the VFAT will
take precedence for MS-DOS compatible volumes.

Also, at least one
.I CBIO
module must be initialized on a per-device basis prior to calling
dosFsDevCreate().
See the related documentation for more details and examples.

DEFINING A DOSFS DEVICE
The dosFsDevCreate() routine associates a device with the dosFsLib
functions.  It expects three parameters:
.IP "(1)" 4
A pointer to a name string, to be used to identify the device - logical
device name.
This will be part of the pathname for I/O operations which operate on the
device.  This name will appear in the I/O system device table, which may be
displayed using the iosDevShow() routine.
.IP "(2)"
CBIO_DEV_ID - a pointer to the CBIO_DEV structure which provides interface
to particular disk, via a disk cache, or a partition manager or a
combination of a number of
.I CBIO
modules which are stacked on top of each other to form one of many
configurations possible.
.IP "(3)"
A maximum number of files can be simultaneously opened on a particular device.
.IP "(4)"
Because volume integrity check utility can be automatically
invoked every time a device is mounted,
this parameter indicates whether the consistency check needs to be
performed automatically on a given device, and on what level of
verbosity is required.
In any event, the consistency check may be invoked at a later time
e.g. by calling chkdsk().
See description for FIOCHKDSK ioctl command for more information.
.LP
For example:
.CS
    dosFsDevCreate
	(
	"/sd0",		/@ name to be used for volume   @/
	pCbio,		/@ pointer to device descriptor @/
	10,		/@ max no. of simultaneously open files @/
	DOS_CHK_REPAIR | DOS_CHK_VERB_1
			/@ check volume during mounting and repair @/
			/@ errors, and display volume statistics @/
	)
.CE

Once dosFsDevCreate() has been called, the device can be accessed
using 
.I ioLib
generic I/O routines: open(), read(), write(), close(),
ioctl(), remove(). Also, the user-level utility functions may be used to
access the device at a higher level (See usrFsLib reference page for
more details).

DEVICE AND PATH NAMES
On true MS-DOS machines, disk device names are typically of the form "A:",
that is, a single letter designator followed by a colon.  Such names may be
used with the VxWorks dosFs file system.  However, it is possible (and
desirable) to use longer, more mnemonic device names, such as "DOS1:",
or "/floppy0". 
The name is specified during the dosFsDevCreate() call.

The pathnames used to specify dosFs files and directories may use either
forward slashes ("/") or backslashes ("\e") as separators.  These may be
freely mixed.  The choice of forward slashes or backslashes has absolutely
no effect on the directory data written to the disk.  (Note, however, that
forward slashes are not allowed within VxWorks dosFs filenames, although
they are normally legal for pure MS-DOS implementations.)

For the sake of consistency however use of forward slashes ("/") is
recommended at all times.

The leading slash of a dosFs pathname following the device name is
optional.  For example, both "DOS1:newfile.new" and "DOS1:/newfile.new"
refer to the same file.

USING EXTENDED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
This library supports DOS4.0 standard file names which fit the restrictions
of eight upper-case characters optionally followed by a three-character
extension,
as well as Windows style VFAT standard long file names
that are stored mixed cased on disk, but are case insensitive when
searched and matched (e.g. during open() call).
The VFAT long file name is stored in a variable number of consecutive
directory entries.
Both standards restrict file size to 4 GB (32 bit value).

To provide additional flexibility, this implementation of the
DOS file system provides proprietary ling file name format (VXLONGNAMES),
which uses a simpler directory structure: the directory entry is
of fixed size.  When this option is
used, file names may consist of any sequence of up to 40 ASCII
characters.  No case conversion is performed, 
and file name match is case-sensitive.
With this directory format the
file maximum size is expanded to 1 Terabyte (40 bit value).

.RS 4 4
NOTE:  Because special directory entries are used on the disk, disks 
which use the extended names are 
.I not
compatible with other implementation of the
MS-DOS systems, and cannot be read on MS-DOS or Windows machines.
.RE

To enable the extended file names, set the DOS_OPT_VXLONGNAMES flag 
when calling dosFsVolFormat().

READING DIRECTORY ENTRIES
Directories on VxWorks dosFs volumes may be searched using the opendir(),
readdir(), rewinddir(), and closedir() routines.  These calls allow the
names of files and subdirectories to be determined.

To obtain more detailed information about a specific file, use the fstat()
or stat() routine.  Along with standard file information, the structure
used by these routines also returns the file attribute byte from a dosFs
directory entry.

For more information, see the manual entry for dirLib.

FILE DATE AND TIME
Directory entries on dosFs volumes contain creation, last modification
time and date, and the last access date for each file or subdirectory.
Directory last modification time and date fields are set only when 
a new entry is created, but not when any directory entries are deleted.
The last access date field indicates the date of the last read or write.  
The last access date field is an optional field, per Microsoft.  By 
default, file open-read-close operations do not update the last access 
date field.  This default avoids media writes (writing out the date field)
during read only operations.   In order to enable the updating of the 
optional last access date field for open-read-close operations, you must 
call dosFsLastAccessDateEnable(), passing it the volumes DOS_VOLUME_DESC_ID 
and TRUE.

The dosFs file system uses the ANSI time() function, that returns
system clock value to obtain date and time.  It is recommended that the
target system should set the system time during system initialization
time from a network server or from an embedded Calendar / Clock
hardware component, so that all files on the file system would be
associated with a correct date and time.

The file system consistency checker (see below) sets system clock to
value following the latest date-time field stored on the disk, if it
discovers, that function time() returns a date earlier then Jan 1,
1998, meaning that the target system does not have a source of valid
date and time to synchronize with.

See also the reference manual entry for ansiTime.

FILE ATTRIBUTES
Directory entries on dosFs volumes contain an attribute byte consisting
of bit-flags which specify various characteristics of the entry.  The
attributes which are identified are:  read-only file, hidden file,
system file, volume label, directory, and archive.  The VxWorks symbols
for these attribute bit-flags are:

.IP DOS_ATTR_RDONLY
File is write-protected, can not be modified or deleted.
.IP DOS_ATTR_HIDDEN
this attribute is not used by VxWorks.
.IP DOS_ATTR_SYSTEM
this attribute is not used by VxWorks.
.IP DOS_ATTR_VOL_LABEL
directory entry describes a volume label,
this attribute can not be set or used directly, see ioctl() command
FIOLABELGET and FIOLABELSET below for volume label manipulation.
.IP DOS_ATTR_DIRECTORY
directory entry is a subdirectory,
this attribute can not be set directly.
.IP DOS_ATTR_ARCHIVE
this attribute is not used by VxWorks.

.LP
All the flags in the attribute byte, except the directory and volume label
flags, may be set or cleared using the ioctl() FIOATTRIBSET function.  This
function is called after opening the specific file whose attributes are to
be changed.  The attribute byte value specified in the FIOATTRIBSET call is
copied directly.  To preserve existing flag settings, the current attributes
should first be determined via fstat(), and the appropriate
flag(s) changed using bitwise AND or OR operations.  For example, to make
a file read-only, while leaving other attributes intact:

.CS
    struct stat fileStat;

    fd = open ("file", O_RDONLY, 0);     /@ open file          @/
    fstat (fd, &fileStat);               /@ get file status    @/

    ioctl (fd, FIOATTRIBSET, (fileStat.st_attrib | DOS_ATTR_RDONLY));
                                         /@ set read-only flag @/
    close (fd);                          /@ close file         @/
.CE
.LP
See also the reference manual entry for attrib() and xattrib() for
user-level utility routines which control the attributes of files or
file hierarchy.

CONTIGOUS FILE SUPPORT
The VxWorks dosFs file system provides efficient files storage:
space will be allocated in groups of clusters (also termed 
.I extents
) so that a file will be composed of relatively large contiguous units.
This  nearly contiguous allocation technique is designed to
effectively eliminate the effects of disk space fragmentation,
keeping throughput very close to the maximum of which the hardware is
capable of.

However dosFs provides mechanism to allocate truly contiguous files,
meaning files which are made up of a consecutive series of disk sectors.
This support includes both the ability to allocate contiguous space to a file
and optimized access to such a file when it is used.
Usually this will somewhat improve performance when compared to
Nearly Contiguous allocation, at the price of disk space fragmentation.

To allocate a contiguous area to a file, the file is first created in the
normal fashion, using open() or creat().  The file descriptor returned
during the creation of the file is then used to make an ioctl() call,
specifying the FIOCONTIG or FIOCONTIG64 function.
The last parameter to the FIOCONTIG function is the size of the requested
contiguous area in bytes, If the FIOCONTIG64 is used, the last parameter
is pointer to 64-bit integer variable, which contains the required file size.
It is also possible to request that the largest contiguous free area on
the disk be obtained.  In this case, the size value CONTIG_MAX (-1) 
is used instead of an actual size.  These ioctl() codes
are not supported for directories.
The volume is searched for a contiguous area of free space, which 
is assigned to the file. If a segment of contiguous free space
large enough for the request was not found,
ERROR is returned, with <errno> set to  S_dosFsLib_NO_CONTIG_SPACE.

When contiguous space is allocated to a file, the file remains empty,
while the newly allocated space has not been initialized.
The data should be then written to the file, and eventually, when
all data has been written, the file is closed.
When file is closed, its space is truncated to reflect the amount
of data actually written to the file.
This file may then be again opened and used for further 
I/O operations read() or write(), 
but it can not be guaranteed that appended data will be contiguous
to the initially written data segment.

For example, the following will create a file and allocate 85 Mbytes of 
contiguous space:
.CS
    fd = creat ("file", O_RDWR, 0);             /@ open file             @/
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOCONTIG, 85*0x100000);/@ get contiguous area   @/
    if (status != OK)
       ...                                      /@ do error handling     @/
    close (fd);                                 /@ close file            @/
.CE

In contrast, the following example will create a file and allocate the
largest contiguous area on the disk to it:

.CS
    fd = creat ("file", O_RDWR, 0);             /@ open file             @/
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOCONTIG, CONTIG_MAX); /@ get contiguous area   @/
    if (status != OK)
       ...                                      /@ do error handling     @/
    close (fd);                                 /@ close file            @/
.CE

.IP NOTE
the FIOCONTIG operation should take place right after the file has been
created, before any data is written to the file.
Directories may not be allocated a contiguous disk area.
.LP
To determine the actual amount of contiguous space obtained when CONTIG_MAX
is specified as the size, use fstat() to examine the number of blocks
and block size for the file.

When any file is opened, it may be checked for contiguity.
Use the extended flag DOS_O_CONTIG_CHK when calling open() to access an
existing file which may have been allocated contiguous space.
If a file is detected as contiguous, all subsequent operations on the
file will not require access to the File Allocation Table, thus
eliminating any disk Seek operations.
The down side however is that if this option is used, open() will take
an amount of time which is linearly proportional of the file size.

CHANGING, UNMOUNTING, AND SYNCHRONIZING DISKS
Buffering of disk data in RAM, synchronization of these
buffers with the disk and detection of removable disk replacement are
all handled by the disk cache. See reference manual on dcacheCbio
for more details.

If a disk is physically removed, the disk cache will cause dosFsLib to
.I unmount
the volume, which will mark all currently open file descriptors as
.I obsolete.

If a new disk is inserted, it will be automatically
.I mounted
on the next call to open() or creat().

IOCTL FUNCTIONS
The dosFs file system supports the following ioctl() functions.  The
functions listed are defined in the header ioLib.h.  Unless stated
otherwise, the file descriptor used for these functions may be any file
descriptor which is opened to a file or directory on the volume or to 
the volume itself.
There are some ioctl() commands, that expect a 32-bit integer result
(FIONFREE, FIOWHERE, etc.).
However, disks and files with are grater than 4GB are supported.
In order to solve this problem, new ioctl() functions have been added
to support 64-bit integer results.
They have the same name as basic functions, but with suffix 
.I 64,
namely: FIONFREE64, FIOWHERE64 and so on. These commands
expect a pointer to a 64-bit integer, i.e.:
.CS
long long *arg ;
.CE
as the 3rd argument to the ioctl() function.
If a value which is requested with a 32-bit ioctl() command is
too large to be represented in the 32-bit variable, ioctl() will return
ERROR, and <errno> will be set to S_dosFsLib_32BIT_OVERFLOW.

.iP "FIODISKINIT"
Reinitializes a DOS file system on the disk volume.
This function calls dosFsVolFormat() to format the volume,
so dosFsFmtLib must be installed for this to work.
Third argument of ioctl() is passed as argument <opt> to
dosFsVolFormat() routine.
This routine does not perform a low level format,
the physical media is expected to be already formatted.
If DOS file system device has not been created yet for a particular device,
only direct call to dosFsVolFormat() can be used.
.CS
    fd = open ("DEV1:", O_WRONLY);
    status = ioctl (fd, FIODISKINIT, DOS_OPT_BLANK);
.CE

.iP "FIODISKCHANGE"
Announces a media change. No buffers flushing is performed.
This function may be called from interrupt level:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIODISKCHANGE, 0);
.CE

.iP "FIOUNMOUNT"
Unmounts a disk volume.  It performs the same function as dosFsVolUnmount().
This function must not be called from interrupt level:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOUNMOUNT, 0);
.CE

.iP "FIOGETNAME"
Gets the file name of the file descriptor and copies it to the buffer <nameBuf>.
Note that <nameBuf> must be large enough to contain the largest possible
path name, which requires at least 256 bytes.
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOGETNAME, &nameBuf );
.CE

.iP "FIORENAME"
Renames the file or directory to the string <newname>:
.CS
    fd = open( "oldname", O_RDONLY, 0 );
    status = ioctl (fd, FIORENAME, "newname");
.CE

.iP "FIOMOVE"
Moves the file or directory to the string <newname>:
.CS
    fd = open( "oldname", O_RDONLY, 0 );
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOMOVE, "newname");
.CE

.iP "FIOSEEK"
Sets the current byte offset in the file to the position specified by
<newOffset>. This function supports offsets in 32-bit value range.
Use FIOSEEK64 for larger position values:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOSEEK, newOffset);
.CE

.iP "FIOSEEK64"
Sets the current byte offset in the file to the position specified by
<newOffset>. This function supports offsets in 64-bit value range:
.CS
    long long	newOffset;
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOSEEK64, (int) & newOffset);
.CE

.iP "FIOWHERE"
Returns the current byte position in the file.  This is the
byte offset of
the next byte to be read or written.  This function returns a 32-bit value.
It takes no additional argument:
.CS
    position = ioctl (fd, FIOWHERE, 0);
.CE

.iP "FIOWHERE64"
Returns the current byte position in the file.  This is the
byte offset of
the next byte to be read or written.  This function returns a 64-bit
value in <position>:
.CS
    long long	position;
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOWHERE64, (int) & position);
.CE

.iP "FIOFLUSH"
Flushes disk cache buffers.  It guarantees that any output that has
been requested is actually written to the device:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOFLUSH, 0);
.CE

.iP "FIOSYNC"
Updates the FAT copy for the passed file descriptor, then      
flushes and invalidates the CBIO cache buffers for the file    
descriptor's volume.  FIOSYNC ensures that any outstanding     
output requests for the passed file descriptor are written     
to the device and a subsequent I/O operation will fetch data   
directly from the physical medium.  To safely sync a volume    
for shutdown, all open file descriptor's should at the least   
be FIOSYNC'd by the application.  Better, all open FD's should 
be closed by the application and the volume should be unmounted
via FIOUNMOUNT.
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOSYNC, 0);
.CE

.iP "FIOTRUNC"
Truncates the specified file's length to <newLength> bytes.  Any disk
clusters which had been allocated to the file but are now unused are
deallocated, and the directory entry for the file is updated to reflect
the new length.  Only regular files may be truncated; attempts to use
FIOTRUNC on directories will return an error.
FIOTRUNC may only be used to make files shorter; attempting to specify
a <newLength> larger than the current size of the file produces an
error (setting errno to S_dosFsLib_INVALID_NUMBER_OF_BYTES).
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOTRUNC, newLength);
.CE

.iP "FIOTRUNC64"
Similar to FIOTRUNC, but can be used for files lager, than 4GB.
.CS
    long long newLength = .....;
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOTRUNC, (int) & newLength);
.CE  

.iP "FIONREAD"
Copies to <unreadCount> the number of unread bytes in the file:
.CS
    unsigned long unreadCount;
    status = ioctl (fd, FIONREAD, &unreadCount);
.CE
.iP "FIONREAD64"
Copies to <unreadCount> the number of unread bytes in the file.
This function returns a 64-bit integer value:
.CS
    long long unreadCount;
    status = ioctl (fd, FIONREAD64, &unreadCount);
.CE
.iP "FIONFREE"
Copies to <freeCount> the amount of free space, in bytes, on the volume:
.CS
   unsigned long freeCount;
   status = ioctl (fd, FIONFREE, &freeCount);
.CE
.iP "FIONFREE64"
Copies to <freeCount> the amount of free space, in bytes, on the volume.
This function can return value in 64-bit range:
.CS
   long long freeCount;
   status = ioctl (fd, FIONFREE64, &freeCount);
.CE
.iP "FIOMKDIR"
Creates a new directory with the name specified as <dirName>:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOMKDIR, "dirName");
.CE
.iP "FIORMDIR"
Removes the directory whose name is specified as <dirName>:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIORMDIR, "dirName");
.CE
.iP "FIOLABELGET"
Gets the volume label (located in root directory) and copies the string to
<labelBuffer>. If the label contains DOS_VOL_LABEL_LEN significant
characters, resulting string  is not NULL terminated:
.CS
    char	labelBuffer [DOS_VOL_LABEL_LEN];
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOLABELGET, (int)labelBuffer);
.CE
.iP "FIOLABELSET"
Sets the volume label to the string specified as <newLabel>.  The string may
consist of up to eleven ASCII characters:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOLABELSET, (int)"newLabel");
.CE
.iP "FIOATTRIBSET"
Sets the file attribute byte in the DOS directory entry to the new value
<newAttrib>.  The file descriptor refers to the file whose entry is to be 
modified:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOATTRIBSET, newAttrib);
.CE
.iP "FIOCONTIG"
Allocates contiguous disk space for a file or directory.  The number of
bytes of requested space is specified in <bytesRequested>.  In general,
contiguous space should be allocated immediately after the file is
created:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOCONTIG, bytesRequested);
.CE
.iP "FIOCONTIG64"
Allocates contiguous disk space for a file or directory.  The number of
bytes of requested space is specified in <bytesRequested>.  In general,
contiguous space should be allocated immediately after the file is
created. This function accepts a 64-bit value:
.CS
    long long bytesRequested;
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOCONTIG64, &bytesRequested);
.CE
.iP "FIONCONTIG"
Copies to <maxContigBytes> the size of the largest contiguous free space, 
in bytes, on the volume:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIONCONTIG, &maxContigBytes);
.CE
.iP "FIONCONTIG64"
Copies to <maxContigBytes> the size of the largest contiguous free space,
in bytes, on the volume. This function returns a 64-bit value:
.CS
    long long maxContigBytes;
    status = ioctl (fd, FIONCONTIG64, &maxContigBytes);
.CE
.iP "FIOREADDIR"
Reads the next directory entry.  The argument <dirStruct> is a DIR
directory descriptor.  Normally, the readdir() routine is used to read a
directory, rather than using the FIOREADDIR function directly.  See dirLib.
.CS
    DIR dirStruct;
    fd = open ("directory", O_RDONLY);
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOREADDIR, &dirStruct);
.CE
.iP "FIOFSTATGET"
Gets file status information (directory entry data).  The argument
<statStruct> is a pointer to a stat structure that is filled with data
describing the specified file.  Normally, the stat() or fstat() routine is
used to obtain file information, rather than using the FIOFSTATGET
function directly.  See dirLib.
.CS
    struct stat statStruct;
    fd = open ("file", O_RDONLY);
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOFSTATGET, (int)&statStruct);
.CE
.iP "FIOTIMESET"
Update time on a file.   <arg> shall be a pointer to a utimbuf structure, 
see utime.h.  If <arg> is value NULL, the current system time is used for
both actime and modtime members.  If <arg> is not NULL then the utimbuf 
structure members actime and modtime are used as passed.  If actime is 
zero value, the file access time is not updated (the operation is ignored).  
If modtime is zero, the file modification time is not updated (the operation 
is ignored).   
See also utime()
..CS
    struct utimbuf newTimeBuf;;
    newTimeBuf.modtime = newTimeBuf.actime = fileNewTime;
    fd = open ("file", O_RDONLY);
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOTIMESET, (int)&newTimeBuf);
.CE
.iP "FIOCHKDSK"
This function invokes the integral consistency checking.
During the test, the file system will be blocked from application code
access, and will emit messages describing any inconsistencies found on
the disk, as well as some statistics, depending on the verbosity
level in the <flags> argument.
Depending on the repair permission value in <flags> argument,
the inconsistencies will be repaired, and changes written to disk
or only reported.
Argument <flags> should be composed of bitwise or-ed
verbosity level value and repair permission value.
Possible repair levels are:
.RS
.iP "DOS_CHK_ONLY (1)"
Only report errors, do not modify disk.
.iP "DOS_CHK_REPAIR (2)"
Repair any errors found.
.LP
Possible verbosity levels are:
.iP "DOS_CHK_VERB_SILENT (0xff00)"
Do not emit any messages, except errors encountered.
.iP "DOS_CHK_VERB_1 (0x0100)"
Display some volume statistics when done testing, as well
.iP "DOS_CHK_VERB_2 (0x0200)"
In addition to the above option, display path of every file, while it
is being checked. This option may significantly slow down the test
process.
.IP "NOTE"
In environments with reduced RAM size check disk uses reserved
FAT copy as temporary buffer, it can cause respectively long
time of execution on a slow CPU architectures..
.LP
.RE
See also the reference manual usrFsLib for the chkdsk() user level
utility which may be used to invoke the FIOCHKDSK ioctl().
The volume root directory should be opened, and the resulting file
descriptor should be used:
.CS
    int fd = open (device_name, O_RDONLY, 0);
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOCHKDSK, DOS_CHK_REPAIR | DOS_CHK_VERB_1);
    close (fd);
.CE
.LP
Any other ioctl() function codes are passed to the underlying
.I CBIO
modules for handling.

*
* dosFsVolIsFat12 - determine if a MSDOS volume is FAT12 or FAT16
*
* This routine is the container for the logic which determines if a 
* dosFs volume is using FAT12 or FAT16.  Two methods are implemented. 
* Both methods use information from the volumes boot parameter block
* fields found in the boot sector.
*
* The first FAT determination method follows the recommendations outlined
* in the Microsoft document:
*
* "Hardware White Paper
*  Designing Hardware for Microsoft Operating Systems
*  FAT: General Overview of On-Disk Format
*  Version 1.02, May 5, 1999
*  Microsoft Corporation"
*
* This method is used in the hopes that greater compatability with
* MSDOS formatted media will be achieved.  The Microsoft recommended 
* method for FAT type determination between FAT12 and FAT16 is done 
* via the count of clusters on the volume.
*
* The Microsoft recommended approach is as follows:
*
* 1.) Determine the count of sectors occupied by the root directory
*     entries for this volume, rounding up:
*
* rootDirSecs = ((rootEntCount * dirEntSz) + (bytesPerSec-1)) / bytesPerSec;
*
* Where dirEntSz is 32 for MSDOS 8.3, and 64 for VXLONGNAMES.
*
*
* 2.) Determine the count of sectors occupied by the volumes data region:
*
* dataRgnSecs = totalSecs - (reservedSecs + (nFats * fatSecs) + rootDirSecs);
*
*
* 3.) determine the count of clusters, rounding down:
*

* An alternate method is used when mounting a known VxWorks DOSFS-1.0 volume. 
* This method is used for greater backward compatability with VxWorks 
* DOSFS-1.0 volumes.  See also: SPR#34704.  The VxWorks dosFs1 method 
* deviates from the Microsoft currently recommened method.
*
* This is the VxWorks DOSFS1 method per dosFsVolDescFill(), dosFsLib.c,
* dosFs 1.0, revision history: "03l,16mar99,dgp".  Using the identical 
* method  here will help ensure backward compatablitity when mounting 
* volumes formatted by the VxWorks dosFs1.0 code. 
*
* The VxWorks DOSFS 1.0 approach is as follows:
*
* 1.) Get starting sector of the root directory:
*
* rootSec = reservedSecs + (nFats * secsPerFat);
*
*
* 2.) Get the size of the root dir in bytes:
*
* rootBytes = (nRootEnts * dirEntSz):
*
* Where dirEntSz is 32 for MSDOS 8.3, and 64 for VXLONGNAMES.
*
*
* 3.) Get the starting sector of the data area:
*
* dataSec = rootSec + ((rootBytes + bytesPerSec-1) / bytesPerSec);
*
*
* 4.) Get the number of "FAT entries":
*
* countOfClusts = 
*        ( ( (totalSecs - dataSecs) / secsPerClust) + DOS_MIN_CLUST);
*
*
* 5.) Choose the FAT type based on the count of clusters, note DOSFS1 
* uses less than or equal here.
*
* if (countOfClusts <= 4085) /@ VxDosFs1 uses less than or equal to. @/
*     {
*     /@ use FAT12 @/
*     }
* else
*     {
*     /@ use FAT16 @/
*     }
*
* By mimicking the dosFs 1.0 approach, we should be able to mount
* all dosFs 1.0 volumes correctly.  By using the microsoft recommened
* approach in all other cases, we should be as compatable as possible
* with Microsoft OS's.
*
* The volumes Boot Parameter Block fields MUST be validated for sanity
* before this routine is called.
*
* pBootBuf is not verified, DO NOT pass this routine a NULL pointer.
* This routine is also used by dosFsFmtLib.c
*
* RETURNS: TRUE if the FAT type is FAT12, FALSE if the FAT type is FAT16,
* or ERROR if the data is invalid.
