/*
This library provides routines used to implement drivers for serial
devices.  It provides all the necessary device-independent functions of a
normal serial channel, including:

.PD .1
.iP "" 4
ring buffering of input and output
.iP
raw mode
.iP
optional line mode with backspace and line-delete functions
.iP
optional processing of X-on/X-off
.iP
optional RETURN/LINEFEED conversion
.iP
optional echoing of input characters
.iP
optional stripping of the parity bit from 8-bit input
.iP
optional special characters for shell abort and system restart
.PD
.LP

Most of the routines in this library are called only by device drivers.
Functions that normally might be called by an application or
interactive user are the routines to set special characters, ty...Set().

USE IN SERIAL DEVICE DRIVERS
Each device that uses tyLib is described by a data structure of type TY_DEV.
This structure begins with an I/O system device header so that it can be added
directly to the I/O system's device list.  A driver calls tyDevInit() to
initialize a TY_DEV structure for a specific device and then calls iosDevAdd()
to add the device to the I/O system.

The call to tyDevInit() takes three parameters: the pointer to the TY_DEV
structure to initialize, the desired size of the read and write ring buffers,
and the address of a transmitter start-up routine.  This routine will be
called when characters are added for output and the transmitter is idle.  
Thereafter, the driver can call the following routines to perform the
usual device functions:
.iP "tyRead()" 12
user read request to get characters that have been input
.iP "tyWrite()"
user write request to put characters to be output
.iP "tyIoctl()"
user I/O control request
.iP "tyIRd()"
interrupt-level routine to get an input character
.iP "tyITx()"
interrupt-level routine to deliver the next output character
.LP

Thus, tyRead(), tyWrite(), and tyIoctl() are called from the driver's read,
write, and I/O control functions.  The routines tyIRd() and tyITx() are called
from the driver's interrupt handler in response to receive and transmit
interrupts, respectively.

Examples of using tyLib in a driver can be found in the source file(s) 
included by tyCoDrv.  Source files are located in src/drv/serial.

TTY OPTIONS
A full range of options affects the behavior of tty devices.  These
options are selected by setting bits in the device option word using the
FIOSETOPTIONS function in the ioctl() routine (see "I/O Control Functions"
below for more information).  The following is a list of available
options.  The options are defined in the header file ioLib.h.

.iP `OPT_LINE' 20 3
Selects line mode.  A tty device operates in one of two modes:  raw mode
(unbuffered) or line mode.  Raw mode is the default.  In raw mode, each byte
of input from the device is immediately available to readers, and the input is
not modified except as directed by other options below.  In line mode, input
from the device is not available to readers until a NEWLINE character is
received, and the input may be modified by backspace, line-delete, and
end-of-file special characters.
.iP `OPT_ECHO'
Causes all input characters to be echoed to the output of the same channel.
This is done simply by putting incoming characters in the output ring as well
as the input ring.  If the output ring is full, the echoing is lost without
affecting the input.
.iP `OPT_CRMOD'
C language conventions use the NEWLINE character as the line terminator
on both input and output.  Most terminals, however, supply a RETURN character
when the return key is hit, and require both a RETURN and a LINEFEED character
to advance the output line.  This option enables the appropriate translation:
NEWLINEs are substituted for input RETURN characters, and NEWLINEs in the
output file are automatically turned into a RETURN-LINEFEED sequence.
.iP `OPT_TANDEM'
Causes the driver to generate and respond to the special flow control
characters CTRL-Q and CTRL-S in what is commonly known as X-on/X-off protocol.  Receipt
of a CTRL-S input character will suspend output to that channel.  Subsequent receipt
of a CTRL-Q will resume the output.  Also, when the VxWorks input buffer is almost
full, a CTRL-S will be output to signal the other side to suspend transmission.
When the input buffer is almost empty, a CTRL-Q will be output to signal the other
side to resume transmission.
.iP `OPT_7_BIT'
Strips the most significant bit from all bytes input from the device.
.iP `OPT_MON_TRAP'
Enables the special monitor trap character, by default CTRL-X.  When this character
is received and this option is enabled, VxWorks will trap to the ROM resident
monitor program.  Note that this is quite drastic.  All normal VxWorks
functioning is suspended, and the computer system is entirely controlled by the
monitor.  Depending on the particular monitor, it may or may not be possible to
restart VxWorks from the point of interruption.  The default monitor trap
character can be changed by calling tyMonitorTrapSet().
.iP `OPT_ABORT'
Enables the special shell abort character, by default CTRL-C.  When this character
is received and this option is enabled, the VxWorks shell is restarted.  This is
useful for freeing a shell stuck in an unfriendly routine, such as one caught in
an infinite loop or one that has taken an unavailable semaphore.  For more
information, see the
.I "VxWorks Programmer's Guide: Shell."
.iP `OPT_TERMINAL'
This is not a separate option bit.  It is the value of the option word
with all the above bits set.
.iP `OPT_RAW'
This is not a separate option bit.  It is the value of the option word with
none of the above bits set.

I/O CONTROL FUNCTIONS
The tty devices respond to the following ioctl() functions.  The functions
are defined in the header ioLib.h.

.iP `FIOGETNAME' 20 3
Gets the file name of the file descriptor and copies it to the buffer 
referenced to by <nameBuf>:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOGETNAME, &nameBuf);
.CE
This function is common to all file descriptors for all devices.
.LP

.iP "`FIOSETOPTIONS', `FIOOPTIONS'" 20
Sets the device option word to the specified argument.  For example, the call:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOOPTIONS, OPT_TERMINAL);
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOSETOPTIONS, OPT_TERMINAL);
.CE
enables all the tty options described above, putting the device in a "normal"
terminal mode.  If the line protocol  (OPT_LINE) is changed, the input
buffer is flushed.  The various options are described in ioLib.h.
.iP `FIOGETOPTIONS'
Returns the current device option word:
.CS
    options = ioctl (fd, FIOGETOPTIONS, 0);
.CE
.iP `FIONREAD'
Copies to <nBytesUnread> the number of bytes available to be read in the
device's input buffer:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIONREAD, &nBytesUnread);
.CE
In line mode (OPT_LINE set), the FIONREAD function actually returns the number
of characters available plus the number of lines in the buffer.  Thus, if five
lines of just NEWLINEs were in the input buffer, it would return the value 10
(5 characters + 5 lines).
.iP `FIONWRITE'
Copies to <nBytes> the number of bytes queued to be output in the device's
output buffer:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIONWRITE, &nBytes);
.CE
.iP `FIOFLUSH'
Discards all the bytes currently in both the input and the output buffers:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOFLUSH, 0);
.CE
.iP `FIOWFLUSH'
Discards all the bytes currently in the output buffer:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOWFLUSH, 0);
.CE
.iP `FIORFLUSH'
Discards all the bytes currently in the input buffers:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIORFLUSH, 0);
.CE
.iP `FIOCANCEL'
Cancels a read or write.  A task blocked on a read or write may be
released by a second task using this ioctl() call.  For example, a
task doing a read can set a watchdog timer before attempting the read;
the auxiliary task would wait on a semaphore.  The watchdog routine
can give the semaphore to the auxiliary task, which would then use the
following call on the appropriate file descriptor:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOCANCEL, 0);
.CE
.iP `FIOBAUDRATE'
Sets the baud rate of the device to the specified argument.  For example, the
call:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOBAUDRATE, 9600);
.CE
Sets the device to operate at 9600 baud.  This request has no meaning on a
pseudo terminal.
.iP `FIOISATTY'
Returns TRUE for a tty device:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOISATTY, 0);
.CE
.iP `FIOPROTOHOOK'
Adds a protocol hook function to be called for each input character.
<pfunction> is a pointer to the protocol hook routine which takes two
arguments of type <int> and returns values of type STATUS (TRUE or
FALSE).  The first argument passed is set by the user via the FIOPROTOARG
function.  The second argument is the input character.  If no further
processing of the character is required by the calling routine (the input
routine of the driver), the protocol hook routine <pFunction> should
return TRUE.  Otherwise, it should return FALSE:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOPROTOHOOK, pFunction);
.CE
.iP `FIOPROTOARG'
Sets the first argument to be passed to the protocol hook routine set by
FIOPROTOHOOK function:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOPROTOARG, arg);
.CE
.iP `FIORBUFSET'
Changes the size of the receive-side buffer to <size>:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIORBUFSET, size);
.CE
.iP `FIOWBUFSET'
Changes the size of the send-side buffer to <size>:
.CS
    status = ioctl (fd, FIOWBUFSET, size);
.CE
.LP
Any other ioctl() request will return an error and set the status to
S_ioLib_UNKNOWN_REQUEST.
